          Llamas have been essential pack animals in the Andes for centuries,
          known for their strength and ability to carry heavy loads through
          difficult terrain. Their resilience and sure-footedness make them
          ideal for navigating high-altitude environments.

          Llama wool is valued for its softness and hypoallergenic qualities.
          Itâ€™s spun into yarn for clothing and textiles, with natural colors
          that range from white to deep browns and blacks, making it a
          versatile material for artisans.

          Llamas are social, intelligent creatures that thrive in herds and are
          easy to train. Their gentle nature makes them popular for therapy,
          farming, and recreational activities, though they can defend
          themselves by spitting if threatened. Their intelligence and calm
          demeanor make them highly trainable, often used in farming as guard
          animals to protect livestock, such as sheep, from predators like
          coyotes. Llamas also play a role in eco-tourism, where they
          accompany hikers and trekkers on trails, carrying supplies while
          offering companionship.
