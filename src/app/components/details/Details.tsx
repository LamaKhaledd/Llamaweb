                      <b>The llama,</b> native to the Andes, is a domesticated animal valued for its wool, 
                      meat, and use as a pack animal. Standing 5-6 feet tall, llamas are social and gentle, 
                      making them easy to train. They provide wool for textiles and are well-adapted to cold 
                      mountain climates. Their curious and friendly nature has made them popular worldwide, 
                      symbolizing the Andean culture.

                              Llamas are social, intelligent creatures that thrive in herds and are 
                              easy to train. Their gentle nature makes them popular for therapy, farming, 
                              and recreational activities, though they can defend themselves by spitting if threatened.
                              Their intelligence and calm demeanor make them highly trainable, often used in farming as guard animals to protect livestock, such as sheep, from predators like coyotes. Llamas also play a role in eco-tourism, where they accompany hikers and trekkers on trails, carrying supplies while offering companionship.
